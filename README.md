# Bank Management System in c++

This Bank Management System is a simple, yet powerful console-based application built entirely in C++. The system simulates basic banking operations, providing users with an intuitive interface to manage their bank accounts. This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand the core concepts of file handling, object-oriented programming, and basic algorithms in C++.

## Features
- **Account Management:** Create, update, and delete customer accounts.
- **Transactions:** Perform deposits, withdrawals, and check account balances.
- **File Handling:** All account data is stored securely using file handling techniques.
- **User Interface:** Simple console-based interface for easy navigation and operation.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensures that all transactions are logged and account details are securely updated.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler, e.g., `g++ bank_management_system.cpp -o bank_system`.
3. Run the executable: `./bank_system`.

## How It Works
- The program uses classes to encapsulate the details of customer accounts.
- File handling is used to store and retrieve account information, ensuring persistence across sessions.
